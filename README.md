#### Server
1. Packages to support external apis; axios, rss-parser
2. Packages to support general infrastructure: pg, dotenv, cors, cookie-parser, body-parser

### Install Insructions for Developers
1. Please note that the server expects to connect to one of our hosted databases, or another PG instance which you may use environment variables to specify. See the create_table.sql file for context on db structure
2. To configure connection to postgres database, an environment variable file (.env) should include (with appropriate values assigned of course):
	- DB_USER=
	- DB_NAME=
	- DB_HOST=
	- DB_PWD=
	- PG_PORT=
3. Dev install: 
   * checkout code
   * cd COVIDsimple/
   * run `npm install && npm --prefix ./client install ./client`
   * run `npm start` 
4. At this point both the client and server should be running
5. If you are not immediately redirected, navigate to http://localhost:3000/
6. To just excercise the server api endpoints navigate to http://localhost:5000 and the appropriate end point
